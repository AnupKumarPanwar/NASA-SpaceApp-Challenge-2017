						<h2>
							<strong>A plane ride could be to geoscience outreach what a planetarium is to astronomical outreach:</strong>
							<strong>the perfect venue for sharing big, awe inspiring ideas, with a view to match.</strong>
						</h2>
						<p>
							Flyover Country&trade; is a National Science Foundation funded mobile app for geoscience outreach and data discovery.
              The app analyzes a given path and caches relevant map data and points of interest (POI), saving them for offline use.
              By downloading only the data relevant to a particular path, cache sizes remain reasonable, allowing for a robust
              experience without an internet connection. Flyover Country&trade; exposes geologic maps, fossil localities, basic
              geographic information, georeferenced Wikipedia articles, and the userâ€™s current location, speed, and altitude. More
              data sources are planned for the future. The Flyover Country concept is ideal for road trips, hiking, and other
              outdoor activities, functioning much as an electronic version of the Roadside Geology books. It can also act as a
              data discovery tool for researchers in the field.<br>
